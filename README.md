# 1718_hsleiden_rnaseq
This is an old project I did with a classmate in 2017-2018.
It has both Dutch and english description.
Too bad we did not know about R notebooks back then.
I could clean this up, for the hell of it, but I rather do a new project from scratch.

Data is contained in the 'Data' folder.
The script is in 'brna_1718_inleveren.R'.
Our assignment answers are in 'Verslag transcriptie analyse.docx'.
The assignment itself is stated in 'bRNA_1718_Eindopdracht_v1.0.docx'.

I hope I can still find the teachers assessment.
